SDL_Delay -> Function used to delay
SDL_CreateWindow -> Function used to create a window on the screen
SDL_DestroyWindow -> Clean and destroy a window instance

SDL_Quit -> To clean up

SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_VIDEO) -> Initialize SDL2 libraries

-------------------------------

SDL_CreateRenderer -> Function to create a 2D renderer to draw on
SDL_Renderer* SDL_CreateRenderer(SDL_Window* window,int index, Uint32 flags)

The window where the rendering will be displayed
the index of the rendering driver to initialize, or -1 to initialize the first one supporting the requested flags
SDL_Render_flags

SDL_DestroyRenderer- Use this function to clear the current rendering target with the drawing color.

SDL_Render_Present -> Use this function to update the screen with any rendering performed since the previous call.

-------------------------------

SDL_Surface* SDL_LoadBMP(const char* file) -> Returns a pointer to a new SDL_Surface structure or NULL

-------------------------------

SDL_Surface -> A structure that contains a collection of pixels used in software blitting
n SDL_Surface is basically a struct that contains all the raw pixel data along with 
some meta-information like size and pixel format. Since SDL_Surface is just the raw pixel data, 
it is not optimized in any way and should be avoided when rendering.


SDL_Surface* screenSurface - SDL_GetWindowSurface - Use this function to get the SDL surface associated with the window.

-------------------------------

SDL_Rect -> A structure that contains the definition of a rectangle, with the origin at the upper left
x, y, width and height

-------------------------------

SDL_SetRenderDrawColor -> Use this function to set the color used for drawing operations

-------------------------------

SDL_RenderDrawRect
Use this function to draw a rectangle on the current rendering target.
